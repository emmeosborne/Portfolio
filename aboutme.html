<h3 class="text-left">About Me: </center>
  
  <p> I am currently a senior at Vashon Island Highschool, I play soccer and tennis.
  I am a member of ASB executive board as the secretary. On my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, music, spoiling my cats, eating,
  coding, and sleeping. I was born and raised in West Seattle, I live with my Mom Karen, my dad Ron, and my older sister Anna. My favorite subjects at school 
  are computer science and social studies. I love to travel and so far I've been to Cuba, Spain, Gibralter and Amsterdam. The next places I want to
  visit are Africa, Thailand and Mexico.
